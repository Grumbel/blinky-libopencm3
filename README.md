blinky - libopencm3
===================

Minimal example for a LED blinky project on the blackpill (STM32-F4)
using libopencm3 and NixOS. To build and flash the program via an
ST-Link, just run:

    nix run .#flash-blinky

The full version can be found at:

This is just a distilled version of that, that can be build on NixOS.
